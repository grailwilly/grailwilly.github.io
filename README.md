# 2021 Portfolio
This is to showcase my work and skills.

## Building it simple
I'll be using HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript to complete the Portfolio.

## Heading
I'll use a pen name "Joi Willi". I changed the last letter of my second name and last name to "y" to "i" to remind me that within "I" will start something amazing.

## Blog
I'll be sharing my journey getting on tech. 

## Homepage
I'll include education background, work history, interest, skills and currently working.

## Portfolio
This is separate page to categorize and link my works.

## Service
I will list things I can do for free which will help me improve my skills. I'll add reviews from clients.

## Contact
This is a form where anyone can send me message. 

## FOOTER
